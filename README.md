## 🧪 Running Locally

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/real-sagar/AI-Video-Summarizer.git
cd AI-Video-Summarizer
2️⃣ Start Backend
cd Backend
npm install
npm start
3️⃣ Start Frontend
cd Frontend
npm install
npm run dev
## 🐳 Docker (Backend)

The backend is containerized using Docker with FFmpeg installed at the OS level for reliable media processing in production.

```bash
docker build -t ai-video-summarizer-backend .
docker run -p 10000:10000 ai-video-summarizer-backend
⚠️ Deployment Notes
Render free tier has limited RAM, so video size is restricted

Uploaded files are stored temporarily and removed after processing

FFmpeg is accessed via the system PATH (no OS-specific hardcoded paths)

📌 Key Learnings
Handling FFmpeg in cloud environments

Debugging production-only issues (filesystem, OS differences)

Docker-based backend deployment

Secure environment variable management

Frontend–backend integration using Vite environment variables
